You’re a person (англійською)


You’re a person (англійською)
You know that you’re a person;
You know this; or do you not f
Your smile is unique,
Your pain is unique,
Your eyes — only you have got.

Tomorrow you’ll be here no longer;
No more on this earth will you be.
Others will walk
And will love and will talk,
Others — much better, much eviler than we.

Today all is here just waiting:
The meadows and lakes and the unbounded stawv.
And to live you must rush,
To love you must rush.
Hurry up, wake up, don’t sleep.

For on earth you are still — a person.
And whether you like it or not,
Your smile is unique,
Your pain is unique,
Your eyes — only you have got.
